# Memory Game

This is a simple memory game implemented in Python. The game tests your memory skills by challenging you to remember and recall words in a given order. Each level increases the number of words to remember, providing an escalating difficulty.

## Features

- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty.
- Random selection of words from an external file.
- Case-insensitive word comparison.
- Clear instructions for user input format.
- Display of correct answer when the user makes a mistake.
- Tracking of the maximum level reached by the user.

## Instructions

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
3. Place a text file named `words.txt` in the same directory as the Python script.
4. Add your desired words to the `words.txt` file, separating them by a comma and space (e.g., `Apple, Orange, Banana`).
5. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
6. Run the game by executing the following command:

```bash
python memory_game.py
